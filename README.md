## Description
In this challenge, there is code for generating a password. The first parameter is the length, which is greater than 8 or less than 128 (inclusive). If the length created by the user is outside of those bounds either, the code restarts after an alert. The next parameters, if an in-bounds length is selected, are whether or not the user wants lowercase letters, numbers, special characters, or uppercase letters in their code, respectively. If the user chooses none of the parameters after length, the code alerts the user and the entire code is restarted. Below is picture of the password in which the user has selected a length of 8 and selected every category within their passowrd.
